# Svelte+Supabase example

This is an example project that demonstrates how to use supabase with svelte. 

It provides a component called `<Reaction/>` which acts a universal like button you can drop on any page. It's great for adding to the end of blog posts, documentation pages or any page really.


# Usage

To setup the database, create a project on [supbabase.io](https://supabase.io), then setup the database using the DDL from [setup.sql](https://github.com/joshnuss/supabase-reactions/blob/master/setup.sql)
